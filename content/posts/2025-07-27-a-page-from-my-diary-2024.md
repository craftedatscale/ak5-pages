I arrived in the U.S. on the eve of the elections â€” a moment charged with anticipation and reflection on the state of democracy. Against this backdrop I had the honor of seeing five of my portraits unveiled at the [Harvard Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation](https://ash.harvard.edu/), celebrating leaders who have shaped and upheld democratic values.

# #The Opening

Colleagues and friends joined me for a tour of the space, where we reflected on the opportunities and responsibilities of keeping democracy alive. Creating these pieces was a deeply reflective journey. Through stitches, textures, and up-cycled materials, I sought to honor the resilience and light of these leaders, while paying tribute to the layers of history and culture that shape our understanding of leadership.
